I'm Tim Brooks, a software engineer currently employed at [Staples SparX](http://www.staples-sparx.com/).

I am adept at most JVM languages, particularly Clojure, Scala, and Java. I also have a lot of experience with Python, Javascript, and SQL. I enjoy working on problems related to concurrency, high performance computation, and distributed systems. 

At SparX I write soft real-time machine learning web services. And the infrastructure to support those services.

I am the author of the [Fault](https://github.com/tbrooks8/fault), [Nano](https://github.com/staples-sparx/Nano), and [Sequoia](https://github.com/staples-sparx/Sequoia) libraries. And a contributor to [core.matrix](https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).
