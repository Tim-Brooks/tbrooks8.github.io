I'm Tim Brooks, a software engineer currently employed at [Elastic](http://www.elastic.co/).

I am adept at most JVM languages, particularly Clojure, Scala, and Java. I also have a lot of experience with Python, Javascript, and SQL. I enjoy working on problems related to concurrency, high performance computation, and distributed systems. 

At Elastic I work on ElasticSearch.

I am the author of the [Precipice](https://github.com/tbrooks8/Precipice), [Beehive](https://github.com/tbrooks8/Beehive), [Nano](https://github.com/staples-sparx/Nano), and [Sequoia](https://github.com/staples-sparx/Sequoia) libraries. And a contributor to [core.matrix](https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).
